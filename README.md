More often than not, you find yourself dealing with a lot of data, which is of no use to you in its raw form. The process of cleaning the data enough to input to the analytical algorithm is known as Data Wrangling. It is also referred to as Data Munging.

Key concepts that are usually involved are:

Collecting data
